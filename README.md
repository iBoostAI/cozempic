**50,000+ power users** trust Cozempic to keep their Claude Code sessions lean.

Context cleaning for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — **remove the bloat, keep everything that matters, protect Agent Teams from context loss**.

## What It Does

Claude Code sessions fill up with dead weight: progress ticks, thinking blocks, stale file reads, duplicate CLAUDE.md injections, base64 screenshots, oversized tool outputs, and metadata bloat. A typical session carries 8-46MB — most of it noise that inflates every API call.

Cozempic removes it with **18 composable strategies** across 3 prescription tiers, while your actual conversation, decisions, and working context stay untouched. The guard daemon runs automatically — install once, forget about it.

### Key Features

- **18 pruning strategies** — gentle (5), standard (11), aggressive (18)
- **Guard daemon** — auto-starts via SessionStart hook, monitors and prunes continuously
- **compact-summary-collapse** — 85-95% savings by removing pre-compaction messages already in the summary
- **Agent Teams protection** — checkpoints team state through compaction, reactive overflow recovery
- **Behavioral digest** — extracts your corrections ("don't do X"), persists them to Claude Code's memory system so they survive compaction
- **13 doctor checks** — diagnose and auto-fix session corruption, orphaned tool results, zombie teams
- **Token-aware diagnostics** — exact token counts from `usage` fields, cache hit rate, context % bar
- **Auto-detects 1M context** — correct thresholds for both 200K and 1M models
- **Auto-updates** — checks PyPI daily, upgrades in-place

**Zero external dependencies.** Python 3.10+ stdlib only.

## Install

Pick your package manager:

```bash
# pip (Python ≥ 3.10)
pip install cozempic

# pipx — isolated user install, always available on PATH
pipx install cozempic

# uv / uvx — no install needed, run on demand
uvx cozempic --help

# Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew install Ruya-AI/cozempic/cozempic

# Nix flake
nix profile install github:Ruya-AI/cozempic?dir=packaging/nix
```

AUR (`yay -S cozempic`) and MacPorts (`port install py-cozempic`) submissions are in progress — see [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md) for status and PKGBUILD/Portfile sources.

That's it. Cozempic auto-initializes on first use — hooks are wired globally, guard daemon auto-starts on every Claude Code session. No manual setup needed. Opt out with `COZEMPIC_NO_GLOBAL_INIT=1`.

### As a Claude Code Plugin

Install cozempic (any method above), then inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add Ruya-AI/cozempic
/plugin install cozempic
```

This gives you MCP tools, skills (`/cozempic:diagnose`, `/cozempic:treat`, etc.), and auto-wired hooks.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Auto-detect and diagnose the current session
cozempic current --diagnose

# Dry-run the standard prescription
cozempic treat current

# Apply with backup
cozempic treat current --execute

# Go aggressive on a specific session
cozempic treat <session_id> -rx aggressive --execute

# Check for session corruption
cozempic doctor

# View behavioral digest rules
cozempic digest show

# Show all strategies & prescriptions
cozempic formulary
```

## Strategies

| # | Strategy | Tier | What It Does | Expected |
|---|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | `compact-summary-collapse` | gentle | Remove all pre-compaction messages (already in the summary) | 85-95% |
| 2 | `attribution-snapshot-strip` | gentle | Strip attribution-snapshot metadata entries | 0-2% |
| 3 | `progress-collapse` | gentle | Collapse consecutive and isolated progress tick messages | 40-48% |

| 17 | `mega-block-trim` | aggressive | Trim any content block over 32KB | safety net |
| 18 | `envelope-strip` | aggressive | Strip constant envelope fields (cwd, version, slug) | 2-4% |

### Prescriptions

| Prescription | Strategies | Risk | Typical Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gentle` | 5 | Minimal | 85-95% (with compact boundary) |
| `standard` | 11 | Low | 25-45% |
| `aggressive` | 18 | Moderate | 35-60% |

**Dry-run is the default.** Nothing is modified until you pass `--execute`. Backups are always created.

## Guard — Continuous Protection

The guard daemon monitors your session and prunes automatically:

```bash
# Auto-starts via SessionStart hook after cozempic init
# Or run manually:
cozempic guard --daemon
```

**4-tier proactive pruning** (every 30s):

| Tier | Threshold | Action | Reload? |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Soft | 25% | gentle file cleanup | No |
| Hard | 55% | standard prune | Yes (deferred if agents active) |
| Emergency | 80% | aggressive prune | Yes (forced) |
| User | 90% | manual aggressive | Yes |

**Reactive overflow recovery** — kqueue/polling file watcher detects inbox-flood overflow within milliseconds, auto-prunes with escalating prescriptions, circuit breaker prevents loops.

**tmux/screen** — reload resumes in the same pane via `send-keys`. Plain terminals open a new window.

**Token thresholds auto-detect** — 200K and 1M models detected automatically. Override with `COZEMPIC_CONTEXT_WINDOW=200000` for Pro plan.

## Behavioral Digest

Cozempic extracts your corrections and persists them across compactions:

```bash
# View extracted rules
cozempic digest show

# Manually extract from current session
cozempic digest update

# Sync rules to Claude Code's memory system
cozempic digest inject
```

**How it works:**
- Detects correction signals in your messages ("don't do X", "stop adding Y", "always use Z")
- All corrections start as "pending" and activate after 2 occurrences (prevents one-shot noise from polluting the digest)
- Rules synced to Claude Code's native memory system (`~/.claude/projects/<cwd>/memory/`)
- Claude reads these as feedback memories on every turn — they survive compaction natively
- PreCompact and Stop hooks auto-extract before context is lost

## Agent Teams Protection

When Claude's auto-compaction fires, Agent Teams lose coordination state. Cozempic prevents this with five layers:

1. **Continuous checkpoint** — saves team state every N seconds
2. **Hook-driven checkpoint** — fires after every Task spawn, TaskCreate/Update, before compaction, at session end
3. **Tiered pruning** — soft threshold trims without disruption; hard threshold does full prune + reload
4. **Reactive overflow recovery** — detects inbox-flood within milliseconds, auto-recovers (~10s downtime)
5. **is_protected()** — compact summaries, compact boundaries, content-replacement entries, and behavioral digest messages are never stripped

## Doctor

```bash
cozempic doctor        # Diagnose issues
cozempic doctor --fix  # Auto-fix where possible
```

| Check | What It Detects | Auto-Fix |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `trust-dialog-hang` | Resume hangs on Windows | Reset flag |
| `claude-json-corruption` | Truncated/corrupted JSON | Restore from backup |
| `corrupted-tool-use` | `tool_use.name` >200 chars | Parse and repair |
| `orphaned-tool-results` | `tool_result` missing matching `tool_use` — causes 400 errors | Strip orphans |
| `zombie-teams` | Stale team directories with dead agents | Remove stale dirs |
| `oversized-sessions` | Session files >50MB | — |
| `stale-backups` | Old `.jsonl.bak` files wasting disk | Delete old backups |
| `disk-usage` | Session storage exceeding healthy thresholds | — |

## Commands

```

```

## Hook Integration

After `cozempic init`, these hooks are wired automatically:

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| `SessionStart` | Session opens | Guard daemon + digest inject |
| `PostToolUse[Task]` | Agent spawn | Team checkpoint |
| `PostToolUse[TaskCreate\|TaskUpdate]` | Todo changes | Team checkpoint |
| `PreCompact` | Before compaction | Checkpoint + digest flush |
| `Stop` | Session end | Checkpoint + digest flush |

## Safety

- **Dry-run by default** — `--execute` required to modify files
- **Atomic writes** — `write → fsync → os.replace()` — no partial writes
- **Strict session resolution** — refuses to act on ambiguous matches
- **Timestamped backups** — automatic `.jsonl.bak` before any modification
- **is_protected()** — compact summaries, boundaries, marble-origami state, content-replacement, behavioral digest entries are never removed
- **parentUuid re-linking** — conversation chain integrity maintained after removals
- **Sibling tool_use protection** — tool_use blocks are kept when their tool_result is kept
- **Team messages protected** — Task, TaskCreate, SendMessage never pruned
- **Strategies compose sequentially** — each runs on the output of the previous

## Changelog

### v1.7.1

- **`cozempic reload --session <id|path>`** escape hatch when auto-detect fails in multi-agent sessions. Previously reload had no way to recover from ambiguous session detection, leaving users stuck. Matches `guard --session`.
- Error message now names the flag to use (was "use an explicit session ID" with no instruction on how)
- **Auto-update message clarified**: after upgrade, says "active on next run (this process still vX.Y.Z)" — users no longer think the upgrade failed when `--version` still prints the old number (the running Python process can't hot-swap its own code)

### v1.7.0

- **Telemetry opt-out**: `COZEMPIC_NO_TELEMETRY=1` disables anonymous usage counters
- **Documented configuration**: `COZEMPIC_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`, `COZEMPIC_NO_TELEMETRY`, `COZEMPIC_CONTEXT_WINDOW` env vars

### v1.6.x

- **4-tier pruning**: soft (25%, no reload) → hard (55%, reload) → emergency (80%, aggressive reload) → user (90%, manual)
- **Agent-aware reload**: defers reload at 55% when agents are running, forces at 80%
- **Same-terminal resume**: tmux/screen users get `/exit` + `claude --resume` in the same pane
- **Clean messaging**: only shows strategies that did something, 1-line hook status output
- **1M default**: Opus/Sonnet 4.5/4.6 default to 1M context (CC doesn't use `[1m]` suffix)
- **Auto-upgrade everywhere**: SessionStart hook backgrounds `pip install --upgrade cozempic` on every session. MCP/plugin use `uv run --upgrade`. npm install.js always upgrades.
- **`cozempic self-update`**: force-upgrade from PyPI regardless of install method (pip, uv, editable, clone)
- **Auto-updater fixed**: removed TTY check (was blocking hook-triggered updates), tries uv → pip → pipx

### v1.5.0

- **`tool-result-age` strategy** — age-based tool result compaction. Recent results stay verbatim, mid-age get JSON minified and diff context collapsed, old replaced with compact stubs. Claude can re-read any file. 10-40% additional savings targeting the 45% of session size that tool results occupy.
- 18 strategies total, standard prescription 11, aggressive 18
- Tests: 273 → 283

### v1.4.0 / v1.4.1

- **Track 1 — Bug fixes**: `is_protected()` guard on all strategies, `isSidechain` preserved in envelope-strip, `output_tokens` in token formula, `parentUuid` re-linking, sibling tool_use protection
- **Track 2 — New strategies**: `compact-summary-collapse` (85-95%), `attribution-snapshot-strip`, microcompact-aware `tool-output-trim`
- **Behavioral digest**: extract corrections, sync to Claude Code memory, CLI commands, hook wiring
- **Context window detection**: MCP server and plugin now auto-detect 200K/1M (was hardcoded 200K)
- **Cache efficiency metrics**: `cozempic diagnose` shows cache hit rate
- **transcript_path**: hooks parse session path from payload for faster resolution
- Tests: 165 → 273

### v1.3.0 / v1.3.1

- Writer-safe live prune + sidecar session store
- Guard startup cleanup, updater fixes, MCP maintenance

### v1.2.0 — v1.2.8

- Atomic file writes, strict session resolution, schema-first team detection
- tool-use-result-strip strategy (5-50% on edit-heavy sessions)
- image-strip strategy (keep last 20%)
- Auto-update, install tracking, npm package
- Safety improvements: SIGTERM handler, backup cleanup, permission error handling

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `COZEMPIC_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | auto-detect | Override context window size (e.g. `200000` for Pro plan) |
| `COZEMPIC_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` | off | Skip automatic version checks. Not recommended — Claude Code ships frequent changes and cozempic updates keep strategies compatible with the latest session format. |
| `COZEMPIC_NO_TELEMETRY` | off | Skip anonymous usage counters. Cozempic pings a simple counter on each prune — no personal data, session content, or identifiable information is sent. Helps us prioritize development. |
