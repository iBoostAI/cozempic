"""Cross-process daemon spawn claim — single-flight via O_CREAT|O_EXCL.

History note (BMAD V4 finding, 2026-05-18): the previous implementation of
this module used ``fcntl.flock`` on a separate sentinel file with unlink on
release. That pattern has a textbook flock-unlink race exposed only at
N >= 3 contending processes:

    1. Process A acquires flock on inode I1, completes spawn, unlinks the
       sentinel path → frees the path entry, retains I1 only until A closes
       the fd.
    2. Between A's unlink and A's fd close, B and C each O_CREAT a NEW file
       at the (now-absent) path, getting NEW inodes I2 and I3.
    3. B's ``flock(I2)`` and C's ``flock(I3)`` are on different kernel
       objects → both succeed.
    4. Both B and C proceed past the lock → BOTH ``subprocess.Popen`` →
       both report ``started=True`` for the same session UUID.

Race-reproducer V4 stress (10 processes × 30 iterations) observed this 3
times out of 30, with both 2-winner and 3-winner outcomes, plus one worker
returning the undefined ``started=False, already_running=False, pid=None``
state. Raw evidence: ``/tmp/v4-stress-output.txt``.

The fix (race-reproducer's option 2, approved by team-lead): drop ``flock``
entirely. The PID file IS the lock. ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY`` on the PID
file is a POSIX-guaranteed atomic operation; if two processes race, exactly
one wins with the file create, the other sees ``FileExistsError`` (EEXIST).
This is the same pattern ``reload_lock.py:200-262`` already uses for the
reload-side single-flight.

Lifecycle:
  - On claim (enter): ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW`` on the PID file. Loser
    reads the file, returns ``DaemonAlreadyStarting(holder_pid=<read pid>)``.
    Stale-holder detection: if the read PID is not alive (``kill(pid, 0)``
    fails), unlink + retry once.
  - Inside the claim: caller writes the real daemon PID atomically via
    temp-file + rename (``os.rename`` on same FS is POSIX-atomic). Readers
    transitioning between our parent-PID and the daemon PID observe the OLD
    real PID then the NEW real PID — never a placeholder, never an empty
    file mid-write.
  - On normal exit: the PID file is LEFT in place — the daemon owns it for
    its lifetime; the daemon's shutdown path is responsible for unlinking.
  - On exceptional exit (Popen raised, log open failed, etc.): the PID
    file is unlinked so a retry by the same or a sibling process can
    re-claim cleanly.

The owner-write pattern (parent PID first, then daemon PID via rename):
  Readers that probe between our claim and our rename will see OUR parent
  PID. Since this is a real, alive process, ``_is_guard_running_for_session``
  will treat it as an in-flight daemon and return ``already_running``. By
  the time the rename completes the daemon PID is visible. No "0"
  placeholder ever appears — closes the original Bug 3 too.

Symlink defense: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` mirrors ``reload_lock.py:213-214``. A local
attacker who can write to ``/tmp`` could plant a symlink at our PID path
pointing at an arbitrary file; without O_NOFOLLOW our O_CREAT would follow
the link.

Backward compatibility shim: the ``daemon_spawn_lock`` context-manager API
is kept for the existing test surface (``test_spawn_lock.py`` Unit tests)
and any direct callers. Internally it delegates to ``DaemonSpawnClaim``.
``DaemonSpawnClaim`` is the preferred new API for callers that need access
to the holder PID on contention (the contextmanager loses that information
because the loser shape is just the exception).

# A pidfile younger than this is considered "fresh — a peer is mid-spawn"
# even if the PID it carries is not alive. Rationale: stale pidfiles from
# crashed prior spawns are typically minutes/hours old; a freshly-written
# file with a dead PID is overwhelmingly likely to be a test mock or a peer
# whose daemon hasn't fully started yet. Treating it as stale would let
# multiple peers re-spawn against the same session.
#
# 5 seconds is the default — generous for a clean macOS laptop where a
# Python cold-start + cozempic import is well under 1s. On slower setups
# (CI hosted runners, macOS with Crowdstrike/SentinelOne EDR scanning the
# Python binary, cold filesystem cache after pip install) Popen can take
# several seconds. Operators can override via the
# ``COZEMPIC_PIDFILE_FRESH_SECONDS`` env var without code changes.
#
# Override is parsed at import time and CLAMPED to ``(0, _FRESH_MAX]``.
# Invalid values (non-numeric, NaN, inf, ≤0, > _FRESH_MAX) silently fall
# back to the default — keeps the daemon working rather than failing at
# startup over a misconfigured env var, and prevents operator typos like
# "inf" or "-1" from silently disabling staleness recovery entirely. The
# upper bound matches ``HARD_LOOP_BACKOFF_CAP_SECONDS`` in guard.py — any
# legitimate slow-Popen scenario lives well under 5 minutes; values higher
# than that are almost certainly typos that would let stale pidfiles from
# crashed prior spawns block new ones for hours. Operators who care about
# the active value can read ``spawn_lock._FRESH_PIDFILE_SECONDS``.
