"""Single-flight reload coordinator.

Cozempic has THREE independent code paths that can spawn a reload watcher
(treat session → kill Claude → spawn watcher → osascript new terminal):

  1. `cozempic reload` (cli.py:cmd_reload) — user-initiated
  2. `guard_prune_cycle` (guard.py) — auto-fired at HARD1/HARD2 thresholds
  3. `OverflowRecovery._do_recover` (overflow.py) — reactive overflow detection

Without coordination, all three can fire simultaneously. The production
cascade we observed: user typed `/cozempic treat reload` while the guard
daemon was already crossing its 55% threshold. Both spawned watchers. When
the user typed `/exit`, both watchers detected Claude's death and both opened
new terminals via osascript. Two Claudes attached to the same JSONL → session
conflict → one exited mid-startup → confusing UX.

This module provides a per-session lock that all three paths consult before
spawning a watcher. The first to acquire wins; others see `ReloadLockHeld`
and either fail-fast (CLI), defer to next cycle (guard), or skip (overflow).

The lock file lives at `{tempfile.gettempdir()}/cozempic_reload_<sid:12>.lock`
and contains `<pid>\\n<iso-timestamp>\\n<initiator>\\n`. Stale locks (holder
PID is dead) are auto-cleared. Wedged locks (holder alive but lock age > 30s)
surface as `ReloadLockHeld(wedged=True)` — operator action required.

The session_id is normalized + sanitized to match the existing PID-file naming
convention. Validation prevents path traversal via crafted session IDs.
