"""Mechanical reproducers for the 2026-05-18 cozempic guard crash.

Source handoff: /Users/yanisnaamane/sanofi/silc-data/.claude/handoffs/cozempic-guard-crash-2026-05-18.md

Two bugs to reproduce on the current v1.8.11 / main-branch code:

R1 — Process-vs-process daemon race
    The SessionStart hook fires on both ``startup`` and ``resume`` events. When
    a HARD-threshold reload kicks in and the resume hook fires from two
    different angles within ms of each other, two completely separate Python
    processes call ``start_guard_daemon(session_id=<same uuid>)``. The
    in-process ``threading.Lock`` in ``_spawn_locks`` does NOT span processes;
    only the ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL`` race on the pidfile + the on-disk pid-read
    fallback can prevent a double spawn.

    This test launches TWO ``multiprocessing.Process`` instances synchronized
    at an ``os.Barrier(2)`` instant and asserts that EXACTLY ONE comes back
    with ``started=True`` and the other with ``already_running=True``. Loops
    50× to catch the race window.

R2 — HARD-threshold zero-byte loop
    When ``guard_prune_cycle`` repeatedly returns ``saved_mb == 0`` (because
    the live conversation is dominated by immutable tool-result blocks the
    soft prune cannot touch), the current loop:
      - prints a warning after 3 consecutive 0-byte hards,
      - sleeps ``interval * 4`` once,
      - resets the consecutive counter to 0,
      - keeps looping at the original 30s interval forever.

    A 20-cycle bounded run with mocked dependencies and a counted
    ``time.sleep`` proves the loop never exits, never backs off long-term,
    and never raises a diagnostic exception.
